Technologies Used:
React.js- UI
Bootstrap- CSS framework
About the Code
Getting Started
First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app Clicky-game in the command line. Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd Clicky-game' in the terminal. After that I typed yarn start to open the app in the browser.

Starting to Code
Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files. I only had to alter two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style. The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory. I decided to make three total components for my app, however, it could have been made with much more or probably less.

Components
Card
The card component is where the puppy images are displayed.

Score
The score component is where the score is displayed.

Wrapper
The Wrapper component wraps the card component.

I chose not to do a separate header component but it could be done. In fact, you could have the header component include some of the score details.
